    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>2 cups half-and-half, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup powdered Thai Tea mix</li>
        <li>1 egg, beated</li>
        <li>1 (14 oz) can of sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>12 chocolate sandwhich cookies (ex: Oreo), crushed</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat heavy cream, 1 cup half-and-half, and milk in a saucepan over medium heat until it begins to simmer, about 10 minutes; stir in Thai tea mix and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer 5 minutes, or up to 10 minutes for more tea flavor.</li>
        <li>Whisk about 1/4 cup cream mixture, a teaspoon at a time, into beaten egg; whisk beaten egg mixture into cream mixture in saucepan and cook until slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Strain cream mixture through a cheesecloth-lined sieve; discard tea leaves.</li>
        <li>Beat remaining 1 cup half-and-half, sweetened condensed milk, and vanilla extract into cream mixture until well blended; cover and chill for at least 6 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Freeze cream mixture in ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions. When ice cream is semi-solid, churn in 3/4 of the crushed chocolate sandwich cookies; continue to churn until ice cream is desired consistency, then fold in remaining cookies. Serve immediately or freeze for several hours for a harder ice cream.</li>
