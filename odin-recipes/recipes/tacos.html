    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Dried chile peppers:</b> The flavorful birria starts with dried guajillo chile peppers, chile de arbol peppers, and ancho chiles. For a bit of extra heat, don't remove all the seeds.</li>
        <li><b>Beef:</b> Beef chuck roast is perfect for braising for hours. When you're done, the meat will shred incredibly easily.</li>
        <li><b>Seasonings:</b> You'll need salt, pepper, fresh garlic, whole cloves, cinnamon, cumin, thyme, marjoram, and oregano.</li>
        <li><b>Olive oil:</b> Sear the meat in olive oil before you add the braising liquid.
        </li>
        <li><b>Tomatoes:</b> Grill Roma tomatoes before blending them with other ingredients to unlock extra layers of flavor.</li>
        <li><b>Vinegar:</b> Two tablespoons of white vinegar adds even more acidity to the braising liquid.</li>
        <li><b>Tortillas:</b> Use store-bought or homemade corn tortillas.</li>
        <li><b>Onion and cilantro:</b> Finish each taco with chopped onion and fresh cilantro for a final punch of flavor and texture.</li>
    </ul>
